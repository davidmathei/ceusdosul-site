The interior regions of the Algarve and eastern Alentejo with their wide open landscapes, offer breathtaking night skies over 200 nights per year.
Don't wait to book your astronomy holiday with us!

<!-- In 2017 the idea was born to load a collection of telescopes into a van and drive them to dark sites to share them with the curious, 
new to stargazing and with experienced observers alike. -->

Our goal is to bring you under the stars, making you see and understand what makes the universe tick.
We offer binoculars for spectacular wide-field viewing of the Milky Way, 
large mirror and lens telescopes that let you discover distant objects in our galaxy as well as surface details on the planets and the moon. 
With our video astronomy set up, details otherwise not visible to the human eye can be presented to larger groups.

This is how you can meet us:
