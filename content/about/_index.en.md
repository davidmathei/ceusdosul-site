The interior regions of the Algarve and eastern Alentejo offer wonderful dark skies for most of the year, spanning over an amazing landscape. Start your astronomy holidays with us!

In 2017 the idea was born to load a collection of telescopes into a van and drive them to dark sites to meet there with the curious, new to stargazing and with experienced observers alike.
Our goal is to bring you under the stars, making you see and understand what makes the universe tick.

There are several ways to meet us:

* Choose one of the upcoming events from our [agenda](/agenda) or follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ceusdosul) and just come along. For some sessions we organize bus transport from central points (Lagos, Silves).
* phone or mail us to make a date. In principle the minimum number of people for a sessions is 4.
* We're happy if you contact us also for private occasions or company events.
