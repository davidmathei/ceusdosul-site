The interior regions of the Algarve and eastern Alentejo offer wonderful dark skies for over 200 days per the year, spanning over an amazing landscape. They are waiting for you to start your astronomy holidays with us!

In 2017 the idea was born to load a collection of telescopes into a van and drive them to dark sites to share them with the curious, new to stargazing and with experienced observers alike.
Our goal is to bring you under the stars, making you see and understand what makes the universe tick.

We have binoculars for you for spectacular wide field views of the Milky Way, several mirror and lens telescopes that let you dig deeper into our galaxy and to show you details on the surface of planets and the moon and finally a video astronomy set up that shows details that are otherwise not visible for the human eye.

This is how you can meet us:

* Choose one of the upcoming events from our [agenda](/agenda) or follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ceusdosul) or [facebook](https://facebook.com/ceusdosul) and just come along. For some sessions we organize bus transport from central points (Lagos, Silves).
* Phone or mail us to make a date. In principle the minimum number of people for a session is 4.
* We're happy if you contact us also for private occasions or company events.
