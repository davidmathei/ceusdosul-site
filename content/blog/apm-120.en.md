These turn out to be indeed amazing: easy to set up and use within minutes.
The APM is just perfectly suited to point it at random areas of the sky and just hop from object to object, not searching but finding them.

Using the fork-mount with encoders and a Nexus unit just adds some minutes for alignment.
The tripod should be set up level to keep the binos from swinging around, but together with the fork mount, movement is as easy as is fixing them in position.

We have them with 24mm,18mm and 12.5mm eyepieces that cover all from wide field views up to spectacular views of the moon. The Docter 12.5 eyepieces show
globular clusters and galaxies with strong contrast and excellent edge-to-edge sharpness. The APM 24mm give an immersive wide-field view that allows for unlimited star-hopping.

Binocular viewing immerses the viewer into a sea of stars in the milky way and allows for long sessions that do not tire your vision as much as monocular viewing does.
Easy and intuitive in use, we take the APM 120 to all our observing sessions.
