[David Lukehurst](http://www.dobsonians.co.uk/) built a fantastic 18 inch Dobsonian for us.

A dobsonian of that size is just about manageable for a mobile observatory, but the fun is in the details: 
The truss assembly is well thought out and all parts one has to touch to collimate the optics are easily accessible. 
Setup and collimation just took minutes the very first time.
