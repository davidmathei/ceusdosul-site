2018 is a great year to observe our neighbours in the solar system. During summer, Venus will set late in the West. Her brightness immediately catches the eye as soon as dusk sets in.

Jupiter shows itself prominetly in the South, high in the sky and is the other object that appears early after sunset. 
Its cloud belts and the four bright moons are a joy to observe at our latitude.

Further to the east, in the constellation of Capricorn Saturn can be found, not as bright as in other 
years, but it shows it's rings clearly opened 

And finally Mars. Rising later during the night, its distance to earth is smaller than usual, so it appears brighter and in good telescopes one can distinguish surface features.
