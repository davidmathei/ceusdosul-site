[David Lukehurst](http://www.dobsonians.co.uk/) built a fantastic 18 inch Dobsonian for us.

A dobsonian of that size is just about manageable for a mobile observatory, but the fun is in the details:
The truss assembly is well thought out and all parts one has to touch to collimate the optics are easily accessible.
Assembly and collimation just took minutes the very first time. Moreover, it keeps it's collimation to a narrow degree even after disassembly and transport!

Globular Clusters like M13 or M2 show stars in detail, even color comparisons are possible. Galaxies are more than tiny patches but reveal structures and dust lanes.
After sufficient cool down time of the main mirror, surface details on planets are easily observable.


At f/3.9 a coma corrector is indispensable, but even with the shallow focus region for that focal ratio the moonlite CR-2 focuser reaches pin-point stars easily.
