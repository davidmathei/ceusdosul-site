### Autumn | Winter | Spring
### Art | Astronomy | Patrimony
### São Marcos da Serra | Vila do Bispo | Lagoa
### Summary

The Out-(In)Verno festival focuses on globalism seen through the lens of the Algarve region, offering projects addressing our identity, directed at anyone and everyone, with the goal of offering a great cultural dip into the history of the Algarve, and the whole of Portugal. The initial premise that founded this festival was the goal of offering projects and events showing the bond between Art, Science, and Patrimony.
These elements have opposite dynamics but are permanently woven together, and it is through this idea that the project and its events were created and are planned, allowing for insight and discussions, open to interpretation not only empirical but also poetic. The program includes Concerts, Walks, Astronomy, Street Animation, Exhibitions and Workshops. Events take on the mystery between opposites: from what we see way out there in the far-off world to the effect that has on lives at home. And in the middle are people, our routines, the needs and comforts that come from our pasts, to the discomforts of finding our way in the future - the unknown that often sets the rhythm for our constant interpretation and adaptation of our present lives. This project also wishes to highlight the quincentenary of Circumnavigation by celebrating it through Astronomy.
