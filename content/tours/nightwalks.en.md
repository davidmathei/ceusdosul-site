The full moon is a spectacular sight for everyone, especially from the wide and wild landscapes of the interior Algarve and Alentejo.
What few people realise is that it's actually difficult to see features on the moon's surface during this phase. Observing many objects in the night sky is
difficult due to strong moonlight. What to do?

Together with [ZenTrekk](https://www.facebook.com/zentrekk/) we offer night walks:
taking binoculars with us and appreciating as much as we can of the landscape in the silence of a full moon night.
