The full moon draws eyeballs from everyone, especially on the wide and wild landscapes of the interior Algarve and Alentejo.
What few people realize is that it's actually difficult to see features on its surface during thia phase. Also observation of many objects in the night sky is
more difficult due to the strong moomlight. What to do?

Together with [ZenTrekk](https://www.facebook.com/zentrekk/) we are offering night walks, taking binoculars along the way and appreciate as much as we can of the landscape in the silence of a full moon night.
