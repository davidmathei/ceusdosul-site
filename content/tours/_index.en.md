There are many ways to enjoy the night sky and just as many ways to learn more about it.

We offer a variety of sessions and workshops that are educational as well as entertaining.
See our [agenda](/agenda) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ceusdosul) for upcoming events near you. You can find us at the GPS coordinates published below, and if available, we will organise bus transport to our observatory from a central location.
We also offer reservations for private or company events as well as exclusive bookings for resorts and hotels.
