See planets, galaxies and other objects through our telescopes. We have enough of them, so you don;t need to "draw a number" and wait in line.

You will have a short introduction into orientation on the night sky, the objects we are about to see. Detailed explanations wait for you while you are looking through our telescopes.
The whole session will last about two hours, but is in principle open ended. That should delight expereinced observers who want to have their own go at objectes they can't see from their native sklies.
