See planets, galaxies and other objects through our telescopes. We have a large selection, so you don't need to "draw a number" and wait in line.

You will have a short introduction covering the objects you'll be seeing and we provide detailed explanations while you are looking through our telescopes.
The whole session lasts about two hours.
Experienced observers can have their own go at exploring objects they can't see from their native skies.
