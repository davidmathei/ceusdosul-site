You came for the sun, there it is. It is too bright to look at, and you know you never should look into the sun with a telescope or binoculars.

There is much activity on the sun though: sun spots, protuberances, granules are all signs of the powerful activity on the surface of our central star that can be seen through our solar telescopes. See in our [agenda](/agenda) when we are in a city close to you and find us in the center.
