Video Astronomy or Electronically Assisted Astronomy (EAA) has opened a new way of seeinng the sky in recent years. The usage of a camera and a fast telescope allows for almost real time viewing of celestial objects that are beyond reach of most amateur telescopes. Galaxies, gas nebulas, remnants of exploded stars, globular clusteres appear before your eyes in a way you couldn't see them before.

EAA also makes stargazing accessible for people who are visually impaired, or who are not mobile enough to look through a conventional telescope. It is also convenient for seeing the sky in a larger group.
