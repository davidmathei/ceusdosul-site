## coming soon!

Video Astronomy or Electronically Assisted Astronomy (EAA) has opened a new way of seeing the sky in recent years.
The usage of a camera and a fast telescope allows for almost real-time viewing of celestial objects that are beyond reach of most amateur telescopes.
Galaxies, gas nebulas, remnants of exploded stars and globular clusters appear before your eyes in a way you haven't seen them before.

EAA also makes stargazing accessible for people who are visually impaired,
or who are not mobile enough to look through a conventional telescope.
It is also convenient for larger groups of viewers.

We use a Celestron RASA on a Mesu 200 mount together with a ASI ZWO294mc camera for spectacular color views of the Universe.
