Video Astronomy or Electronically Assisted Astronomy (EAA) has opened a new way of seein g the sky in recent years. The usage of a camera and a fast telescope allows for almost real time viewing of celestial objects that are beyond reach of most amateur telescopes.

EAA also makes stargazing accessible for people who are visually impaired, or who are not mobile enough to look through a conventional telescope. Above all: many people can see at the same time.
