Do you need a telescope to enjoy watching the sky? Of course not. Astronomy was done for thousands of years with bare eyes and easy to construct simple instrumemts.
That was sufficient to determine th at paths of the planets, usxe of the sky as a natural calendar and to derive importrant properties of our universe just by using the Mark II Eyeballs telescope as some call it.

The constellations, groups of stars that are named after mythological entities, give us the primary orientation on the sky, although they didn't look like this in prehistorict times.
We'll talk about how they can be used as a calendar subdividing the year. Also we show hoe the constellations point to each other and how you can find teh lesser known ones by "hopping" from the ones that are easily identified. ("Big Dipper" anyone?)

Where is north? South? We are going to find that out.
What and whre is the Zodiac and how does it differ from the one that is used in Astrology?

If you arrive early enough we will point out the Belt of Venus, if you bear with us until dusk, we will talk about heliacal rising and its importance in Egyptian and Babylonian Astronomy. (You will need a lot of stamina for that trough, and possibly a warm jacket)
