Do you need a telescope to enjoy watching the sky? Of course not. Astronomy was done for thousands of years with bare eyes and simple instruments.
We show you how to find your way among the stars, identify stars and constellations.

<!--more-->

The constellations, groups of stars that are named after mythological entities, give us the primary orientation on the sky.
We'll talk about how they can be used as a calendar subdividing the year. Also we show hoe the constellations point to each other and how you can find the lesser known ones by "hopping" from the ones that are easily identified.
