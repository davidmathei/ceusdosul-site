Experience the dark and clear night skies of Portugal, the Céus do Sul, or Southern Skies. See planets, stars and galaxies through our telescopes on a night sky safari. We guide you across the celestial wonders, all you have to do is look up.
If you’re in for a introduction in astronomy or if you are an experienced observer: join us where the earth meets the sky.

Ceus do Sul is a mobile astronomical observatory that travels along the dark Portuguese skies of the western Algarve and Alentejo. Not only are the landscape and darkness of the skies worth a night out. but the latitude of 37 degrees
lets you look deeper than northern horizpns allow. This puts the planest higher in the sky (and you should not miss Mars , Jupiter and Saturnus in 2018), also Sagittarius and Capricornus expose the center of our Milky Way better than in northern countries.
