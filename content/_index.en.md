Experience the dark and clear night skies of Portugal, see planets, stars and galaxies through our telescopes on a night sky safari. We guide you across the celestial wonders, all you have to do is look up.
If you’re in for a introduction in astronomy or if you are an experienced observer: join us where the earth meets the sky.

Ceus do Sul is a mobile astronomical observatory that travels along the dark Portuguese skies of the western Algarve and Alentejo.
