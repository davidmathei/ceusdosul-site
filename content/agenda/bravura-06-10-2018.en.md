At this dark spot close to the lake we will set up some telescopes and give you a guide through the constellations and interesting objects that can be found there.
We'll show you planets, globular and open clusters, gas nebulas and will explain to you what they are and how they came to be.

## How to get there:

Leaving Lagos northwards in the direction of Bensafrim follow the road for about 4km until the sign "Cotifo" or "Barragem da Bravura".
Enter that road and follow it until the village of Cotifo.
At the end of the road go to the left and follow the signs "Barragem" up the hills.
After more 5 minutes you reach the restaurant Hello Goodbye (we can recommend their indonesian food) and park your car. On the field just below the restaurant you will find us!
