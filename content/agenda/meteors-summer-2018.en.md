On August 13 the earths orbit crosses again the dust trail left behind by the comet Swift-Tuttle, resulting in a shower of meteoroids or "falling stars".

This particular event is known as the Perseids, as all of these particles seem to come from the constellation of Perseus.
In the dark, moonless night this is a spectatcular sight that you can best enjoy with bare eyes.

We invite you to come watching with us and we will have some telescopes ready to show you other objects of the night sky.
