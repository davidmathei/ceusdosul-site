On Saturday June 16th we will set up some telescopes at the Barragem do Bravura near Cotifo (GPS: 37.197808, -8.706089) to take some pictures for our publicity with Photographer [Jorge Marques](http://jorgefmarques.com/).

Setup will be around 20:00 and it will be dark enough for viewing from ca. 21:00. Warm clothes are advised :)
