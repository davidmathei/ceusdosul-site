Meet us at Barragem da Bravura, 10 minutes from Lagos, to have a look to the east where the full moon is rising. 
Over the next hours we will see it darken and become reddish in colour, as the shadow of the earth passes over it.

Full Moon nights are not the best times of the months to see stars, but you should not miss a lunar eclipse!
We have telescopes and binoculars available to also show you around other objects of our night skies.

Location: Barragem da Bravura\
Price: &euro; 5\
Time: 20:30 - 23:00\

## How to get there:

Leaving Lagos northwards in the direction of Bensafrim foillow the road for about 4km until the sign "Cotifo" or "Barragem da Bravura".
Follow that road until the village of Cotifo and at the end go to the left and follow the signs "Barragem" up the hills. 
After more 5 minutes you should see us standing on a gravel road in a curve that leads down to the dam.

For this event we will set up our telescopes up on top of the hill to have a free view towards the rising full moon. It can be windy up there, so don't forget your jackets!
