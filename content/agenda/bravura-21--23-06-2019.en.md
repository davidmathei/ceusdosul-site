## How to get there:

Leaving Lagos northwards in the direction of Bensafrim follow the road for about 4km until the sign "Cotifo" or "Barragem da Bravura".
Enter that road and follow it until the village of Cotifo.
At the end of the road (at the t-split) go to the left and follow the signs "Barragem" up the hills.
After more 5 minutes you reach the top of a hill overlooking the lake, where the road goes to the left down to the lake. You can park your car at the beginning of the dirt road starting just ahead of the curve, about 20 meters further in you will find us.
